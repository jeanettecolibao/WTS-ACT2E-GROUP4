Radio transmitting devices located with pinpoint accuracy with new technique

A new device for quickly locating any object that is transmitting a radio signal including cell phones, signal jammers or tracking tags has been developed by researchers at Grenoble Alpes University. 

Known as an analogue photonic correlator, the device is considerably simpler than equivalent devices existing today, the researchers said. 

“The photonic architecture we developed uses no moving parts and enables real-time signal processing,” said researcher Hugues Guillet de Chatellus. “Real-time processing helps ensure there isn’t any downtime, which is critical for defence applications, for example.” 

Many of today’s radio signals have large bandwidths in order to increase the amount of data they can carry. The device offers a simple method for correlating signals with bandwidths of up to a few GHz, a larger bandwidth than is available from commercial approaches based on purely digital techniques. 

It can be used to compute what is known as a cross-correlation function for two signals emitted from one source and detected by two antennas. This measures the similarity of the signals as a function of the displacement of one signal relative to the other and provides information about their relative delay, which can be used to calculate the location of the signal’s source.

“The photonic architecture we developed enables real-time calculation of the cross-correlation function of two input signals for about 200 values of relative delay simultaneously,” said Guillet de Chatellus. “This is much higher than any photonic technique has been able to accomplish so far.” 

The correlator works like a photonic processor by using fibre optic components to turn two radio-frequency signals into optical signals. Once the cross-correlation function is calculated, a detection and processing chain enables it to be converted into a digital format.
The most critical component of the new system is a frequency shifting loop, which can generate and manipulate a large number of time-shifted replicas for an input signal. This simple photonic component has enabled many recent innovations in microwave photonics. 

“We’ve been developing frequency shifting loops for some time, and a deep understanding of their architecture led us to apply them to this new application,” said Guillet de Chatellus. “This work shows that photonics can offer efficient alternatives to solutions that are based on digital electronics.” 

After testing their new device using high-power simple signals, the researchers tested it with more complex signals and then moved to signals propagating through free space and received by a pair of antennas. 

The researchers were able to demonstrate localisation of a radio-frequency transmitter with a precision close to 10 picoseconds for a 100-millisecond integration time. This means that the system could locate an emitter with a precision of about 3 millimetres. 

The device can also be used in astronomy to cross-correlate signals coming from several telescopes to create high-resolution images. In the coming months, the researchers plan to work on a demonstration experiment in which signals emitted from the sun at around 10GHz will be collected by two remote antennas and cross-correlated using the new photonic device to create an image of the sun at radio-wavelength. 

The researchers are also performing experiments to find out if the new photonic correlator can be used to correlate three signals, which would enable 3D localisation of transmitters by triangulation..</p>

<article> 
<head> It’s 2020 and there is no arguing that technology plays a vital role in our lives. Technology does everything from allowing us to explore the vast expanse of our solar system to helping us kill a few minutes while we wait for our bus. So, it is no surprise that technology has a major impact on education. Although many schools across the world are taking advantage of technology in the classroom, others are not so lucky. A technology gap currently exists in schools of the Philippines that is preventing its students from enjoying the advantages provided by technology in the classroom.
Countless studies have established that technology is a beneficial supplement to the education system. One such study, done by Sean M. Corcoran, Ed.D, focuses on the effects that tablet apps have on reading instruction of first-grade students. The students using tablet apps performed better than the ones without these apps. Thus, Corcoran’s research concludes that “the use of tablet apps during reading instruction had a statistically significant impact on student achievement.” Technology has a positive impact on education, and the people of the Philippines have taken notice. An article published by The Manila Times highlights a study done by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in California. This study “showed that students using iPads performed better in math compared to students using traditional textbooks.” The article goes on to list even more convincing evidence by citing an Oklahoma State University study which “found that 75 percent of students said use of gadgets enhanced their learning experience.” With so many advantages, it is easy to understand why the Philippines is looking to increase its use of technology for improving education. </article> </head>

<p> DNA computers take up less space than silicon-based ones and can work in wet environments. They could be used for applications such as detecting contamination in drinking water or monitoring sugar levels in the body.


Previous designs have used fluorescent labels to show results and can only output tens of results simultaneously. They also require complex microscopes to read these findings.


“One hundred-fold is a conservative estimate of how much more parallel processing we can do with our DNA computer compared to ones that use fluorescent labels,” says Khalid Salaita at Emory University in Atlanta, George 
Salaita and his colleagues made the computers out of DNA-coated glass microbeads that either roll or stall on the surface of a gold chip depending on how the DNA strands interact with molecules attached to the chip’s surface. Rolling is equivalent to an output of 1, while stalling corresponds to an output of 0.

The results of the computation can be detected by tracking the motion of the beads using a smartphone camera with a simple magnifying glass attached to it.


“That’s the wild thing. You can convert the information from the DNA computational operation to the macroscopic world using a standard smartphone in just 15 minutes,” says Salaita.</p>

The researchers then added a DNA “lock complex” into the computer, which enabled the presence or absence of a specific DNA molecule to control the movement of the bead. They confirmed that the presence of the DNA molecule stalled the bead, while its absence allowed the bead to roll. This system can be easily adapted to detect any DNA of interest in the environment.

As there are thousands of possible microbeads with different shapes and sizes, the researchers say the computers could output thousands of read-outs in parallel. They hope the device could provide a quick way to detect virus levels in saliva. “The really neat thing is that multiple parallel operations could be used to figure out if you have SARS-CoV-2, but also if you have influenza A and another pathogen, for example,” says Salaita.

However, further work is needed to find ways to restock the RNA molecules on the chip surface, which can degrade after 24 hours and limit the lifespan of the computers. </article> </head>

Radio transmitting devices located with pinpoint accuracy with new technique
